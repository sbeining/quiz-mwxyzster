# Quiz Mwxyzster - The quiz master

This is a very simple slideshow for quiz questions that can be
easily configured by dropping plaintext files into a folder.

## Configuration

* Create a directory called "questions" next to the executable
* Drop plaintext (e.g. ".txt") files into that directory with one
  question per line
  * You can put all questions in one file, or split them into
    categories / rounds
  * The filenames affect the order of the questions
